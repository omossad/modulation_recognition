# Modulation Recognition using MTL-CNN
This repository provides the source code for the **IWCMC 19'** paper titled: [Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Multi-Task Learning Scheme for Modulations Recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8766665)
### In order to execute the code, you will need to do the following:
-First, download the [RadioML dataset](http://opendata.deepsig.io/datasets/2016.10/RML2016.10a.tar.bz2)
-Next, execute the code **mtl_cnn.ipnyb** after adjusting the dataset path
-Finally, you can use the provided Matlab codes to better visualize the results.
